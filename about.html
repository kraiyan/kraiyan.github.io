            <h2>This is me...</h2>
            <p>
              ...born in Bavaria, I've lived in several
              different countries (Austria, Chile, USA, UK,
              Netherlands, and Mexico) before coming to
              Berlin. My experience is in a variety of
              industries and roles, where I've had the
              opportunity to develop my skills in problem
              solving, working as part of a team and
              analytical skills. For example in my role as
              Office Manager at a start-up, I was used to
              figuring out pain points and how to solve them
              quickly, often in creative ways. I've worked
              with a variety of cultures, which allowed me
              to learn how to communicate effectively and
              without fear.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm transitioning to software development
              because this is where I know I can make an
              even bigger impact, being solution focused and
              enjoying connecting dots and people.

                  I strongly believe that being your

                  talents and characteristics to the table
                  and create something awesome. We can learn
                  something from EVERYONE.

                  I love to challenge myself and being

                  essential to find an even better and
                  efficient way of doing things. Everyone
                  makes mistakes, owning them and learning
                  from them is how I grow.

                  Working as a team is how we can create
                  synergies and momentum to overcome
                  obstacles. However, being part of a team
                  also means both to be able to work
                  independently and carry my own weight and
                  to ask for help when I'm stuck.
